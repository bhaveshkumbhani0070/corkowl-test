## About code

`App.js` there are full layout with `navbar`,`sidebar`,`component` and `dashboard`, it import all that component and load it to view on screen.

I made some basic folder structure with `component` and `layout` folder. inside`component` there are comman components are like `Logo`, `search` for input search bar are included and in `layout` folder there are `chart`,`Counter`, `navbar`,`LineChart`,`sidebar`,`Navbar`, `Table`,`View` are added. Every component or layout have it's own styles so i created it's own style. For chart i used react-chartjs-2 and for table used react-data-table-component
